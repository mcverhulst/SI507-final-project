Final project for SI 507

This project allows for the user to enter two names of National Hockey League (NHL) players names and compare their statistics. After entering the names of the players they would like to compare, the script utilizes web scraping to collect the relevant data on each player. The data is then presented in a figure with four subplots using matplotlib. These four subplots show each player's goals, assists, points, and games played by season.

Instructions: When prompted, enter the names of two players separated by a comma. Some examples:
* Alexander Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby
* Evgeni Malkin, Auten Matthews
* Dylan Larkin, Jack Eichel
